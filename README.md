## Overview
This project is a React application showcasing delicious and authentic Moroccan Tajine recipes, allowing customers to order tajines and get them delivered to their home, built with modern web development technologies.

## Features:
-  Very simple application, where users can order one or more tajines from a menu.
-  Requires no user accounts and no login: users just input their names before using the app.
-  ﻿﻿Users can add multiple tajines to a cart before ordering.
-  ﻿﻿Ordering requires just the user's name, phone number, and address.
-  ﻿﻿If possible, GPS location should also be provided, to make delivery easier.
-  ﻿﻿User's can mark their order as "priority" for an additional 20% of the cart price.
-  Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app.
-  Each order will get a unique ID that should be displayed, so the user can later look up their order based on the ID.
